### Installation
Before installing Collect, please make sure that `git`, `node` and `npm` are installed.

*Note*: This server was tested on `NodeJS v7.7.3` and `NodeJS v6.13.1`.

Start by cloning the repository to your computer/server:
```
git clone https://github.com/xarantolus/Collect.git
```

Go in the `Collect` directory
```
cd Collect/Collect
```

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

To start in `production` mode (recommended), type
```
npm start production
```
or 
```
node app production
```

When you open the website in your browser, you will notice that you need to authenticate.

#### Settings
To change settings, edit `Collect/config.json`. There, you can set a `port`, `username`, `password`, `id_length` and `api_token`.

<details><summary>Settings documentation</summary>

###### Port
The port the server should listen on. If another program uses this port, the server will not be able to start.

###### Username
The username that should be used to log in.

###### Password
The password for this user. [Please don't use a password you use somewhere else.](#security-considerations)

###### ID length
The length of the ids the server should generate. If you save **a lot** of websites from the same domain (> ~1 million / 16<sup>length</sup>) you should change this number.

###### API token
If you like to play around with the API, you can set an API token. It is implemented so integrating apps like [Workflow](https://workflow.is) is easy.

If you don't want to use the API, it is recommended to set the token to a long random string.

#### Plugins
It is recommended to use [`PhantomJS`](http://phantomjs.org/) to process the websites after downloading.
This ensures that dynamically loaded content is also saved.


To use this, install the [`node-website-scraper-phantom` module](https://github.com/website-scraper/node-website-scraper-phantom).
```
npm install website-scraper-phantom
```

This command must be run in the directory that contains the `package.json` file.

After installing, the server should output `PhantomJS will be used to process websites` when started.

If the install fails, you cannot use the module and __*Collect*__ will fall back to the normal way of saving pages.

If you cannot save any pages after installing, remove the module by running 
```
npm uninstall website-scraper-phantom
```

### Updating
If you already have Collect installed on your computer/server and want to update to the latest version, follow these steps.

Go in the directory where Collect is installed.
```
cd /path/to/Collect
```

You might want to back up your settings file.

Windows:
```
move Collect\config.json ..\
```

Linux/Unix:
```
mv Collect/config.json ../config.json
```

Download the latest version:
```
git fetch --all
```

Apply all changes (this usually overwrites your cookies file, but not the directory where your sites are saved.)
```
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Restore the settings file.

Windows:
```
move ..\config.json Collect\
```

Linux/Unix:
```
mv ../config.json Collect/config.json
```

Go to the directory that contains `package.json`.
```
cd Collect
```

Install all required packages.
```
npm install
```

After restarting your server, the new version should be up & running.

#### Tools
This project is being developed in Visual Studio 2017.

The following extension(s) are used:
* [Bundler & Minifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.BundlerMinifier)

## Security considerations
   * The login system uses plain text. Anyone with (e.g. `SSH`) access to your server can read it.
   * Any site you download can read & set cookies. A downloaded website could send your login cookie to another server. If you host this software in your private network without outside access, everything should be fine even if a cookie gets stolen, but don't take my word for it.
   * The connection does by default not use `HTTPS`.
